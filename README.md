# Steganography-Digital-Image-processing-
The code hides text in an image.
The logic used here is:
   Binary form of the text is encoded by replacing first and last bit of every pixel with the bits of text.
   The length of the meassage has been encoded in the last pixel of the image.
Constraint:
   Length of the binary form of the image should be less than the double of the number of pixels in the image.
